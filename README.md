# Curriculum
COD is a small project that was born between the mighty COVID-19 crysis of the planet earth in 2020. Two friends decided that in quarantine they needed to improve they skills in Web Development. Due to that we decided to create a small website to help us, and other people to share they profiles.

# About Us
The goal was to share our skills both in technologies and soft-skills. This way we could provide a more detailed vision, of our work and ideas. This information can be usefull to coworkers, friends, possible future jobs or even, mere spectators.
